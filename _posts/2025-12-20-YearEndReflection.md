2025: A Year of Milestones, Fatherhood, and Resilience
What a whirlwind 2025 has been! From personal joys to professional triumphs, this year tested me in ways I never expected—but it also delivered some of my proudest moments. As I wrap up the year, here's a quick recap of the highlights and the big lesson it taught me: resilience in the face of uncertainty.

The Personal Highs: Fatherhood and Full Circle Moments
Life came full circle when I became a father. Holding my newborn for the first time was indescribable—a mix of pure joy, terror, and overwhelming love. It has redefined my priorities and given me a new perspective on what truly matters.

This year also brought reconnection. I met up with a few old friends after years apart, sharing laughs and stories that bridged the gap. And just like that, I hit the two-year mark since graduating from IIT Madras. Time flies when you're enjoying life and career.

Professional Wins: Promotion, Taiwan, and Chip-Making Magic
On the work front, I celebrated a well-deserved promotion at Micron, where I've now completed two full years. The real highlight? Traveling to Taiwan to deploy a critical model in the Fab. Deploying it live in the Fab, surrounded by the hum of cutting-edge manufacturing, was exhilarating. More on Taiwan trip later.

The trip peaked with a visit to the Taipei 101 towers—an engineering marvel I'd only seen on the Discovery Channel as a kid. Standing before the Tuned Mass Damper felt like a pilgrimage to this engineering marvel. Life takes you to places you never even dreamed of, and it was an exhilarating reminder of how far I've come. Grateful for every step. Alhamdulillah!

I also delivered on one of the most challenging projects of my career. It directly influenced key decisions in developing one of the most advanced memory chips ever built at Micron. Watching data turn into real-world impact? Pure fun and satisfaction.
The Big Lesson: Embracing Uncertainty with Resilience

Through it all—new parenthood, high-stakes projects, and life's curveballs—2025 taught me resilience. Uncertainty is inevitable, whether it's a crying baby at 3 AM or troubleshooting a model halfway across the world. But pushing through builds strength you didn't know you had.
